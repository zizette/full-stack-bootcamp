# Challenge 6.1

## Objective

Continue exploring asynchronous operations in JavaScript with more practical exercises.

## Step 1: Simple Delay

### Question

## Step 4: Fetch Multiple Dog Images

### Question

You have an array of URLs. Fetch images from all these URLs simultaneously and log the results. Use `Promise.all()` for this challenge.

Use the following API endpoint to get random dog images: [https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random](https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random).
